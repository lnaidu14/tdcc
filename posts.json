    "content": "TechnoDevelop is pleased to announce development of a semi-automated harvest tool to aid harvest of selected vegetables in greenhouses. The tool has been developed keeping the needs of small and medium farms in mind where expensive deployment of fully automated robotic systems may not be feasible due to less structured layouts apart from affordability constraints. The tool incorporates patented Tactile Sensing technology to aid in assessment of ripeness through firmness measure, and patent pending approach using optimized path planning resulting in considerable reduction in harvest and categorization times. TechnoDevelop has commenced the drive to get feedback from potential users of the novel equipment.",
